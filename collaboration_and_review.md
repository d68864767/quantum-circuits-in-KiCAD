# Collaboration and Review

This document outlines the process and importance of collaboration and review in our quantum circuit design project using KiCAD. As quantum computing is a highly specialized field, collaboration with others in the team or field is crucial for the success of the project.

## Sharing KiCAD Designs

The KiCAD designs created during this project will be shared with the team and other experts in the field for review and feedback. This includes the custom component symbols, the schematic design, and the PCB layout. These files are stored as `component_library.lib`, `schematic.sch`, and `pcb_layout.kicad_pcb` respectively.

## Review Process

The review process involves a thorough examination of the KiCAD designs by the team members and other experts. They will provide feedback on the design, suggest improvements, and help identify any potential issues. This collaborative review process is crucial for ensuring the accuracy and efficiency of the quantum circuit design.

## Feedback Implementation

Once the feedback is received, it will be carefully considered and implemented into the design. This may involve modifying the custom component symbols, adjusting the schematic design, or altering the PCB layout. The goal is to improve the design based on the feedback and make it as effective and efficient as possible.

## Final Review

After the feedback has been implemented, the design will undergo a final review. This is to ensure that all the feedback has been properly incorporated and that the design meets all the requirements outlined in the `requirements.md` document.

Remember, KiCAD is primarily a tool for classical electronic design, so using it for quantum circuit design requires a bit of adaptation. The focus with KiCAD will be on the visualization, documentation, and possibly the control electronics aspect of the quantum computing project, rather than the quantum mechanics part itself. Therefore, the collaboration and review process is not just about the KiCAD designs, but also about the overall approach to the quantum circuit design project.
